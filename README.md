CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF DATA SOURCES:

(1) Text used must be in the public domain. Due to the ongoing uncertainty about the exact legal standing of AI applications trained on (or otherwise based) on copyrighted material, only individuals whose works are in the public domain will be considered. This is highly regrettable, as there are a great many people that I would have liked to include. 

(2) The author must have had a significant social, political, or intellectual impact on large numbers of people. The exact scale of impact isn't something that I can quantify precisely. However, their candidacy will be strengthened if:
    - They made significant contributions to the socio-economic or political outlook of large numbers of people 
    - Their work continues to have enduring relevance to their field of study many decades after their passing. 
    - They led or otherwise made notable contributions to major intellectual, political, spiritual, or socio-economic movements of their time.
    - They produced a significant body of written works or speeches.
    

WHY RUST? 
I began buy building all this in Python. It was the natural choice, as it is the de-facto standard in NLP workflows due to the large number of available libraries. 
However, I've been looking to push myself as a developer, and I decided to port the project to Rust as a means to learn the language. Who knows? I might even get good enough to build or contribute to Rust libraries in the area!
