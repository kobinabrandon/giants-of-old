# GIANTS OF OLD
I thought it'd be cool to have my own RAG pipelines for some of the most influential social figures in history. 

## MY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING AUTHORS: 
- Text used must be in the public domain. Due to the ongoing uncertainty about the exact legal standing of AI applications trained on (or otherwise based) on copyrighted material, only individuals whose works are in the public domain will be considered. This is highly regrettable, as there are a great many people that I would have liked to include. 

- The author must have had a significant social, political, or intellectual impact on large numbers of people. The exact scale of impact isn't something that I can quantify precisely. However, their candidacy will be strengthened if:
    - They made significant contributions to the socio-economic or political outlook of large numbers of people 
    - Their work continues to have enduring relevance to their field of study many decades after their passing. 
    - They led or otherwise made notable contributions to major intellectual, political, spiritual, or socio-economic movements of their time.
    - They produced a significant body of written works or speeches.
    
## WHY RUST? 
I began by building all this in Python. It was the natural choice, as it is the de-facto standard in NLP due to the large number of available libraries. 
However, I've been looking to push myself as a developer, and I decided to port the project to Rust as a means to learn the language. I'm also curious to see just how complete the application can be without including any Python code. 

Who knows? I might even get good enough to build or contribute to Rust libraries in NLP!


## SUGGEST SOMEONE
- If you'd like to suggest that I include someone, I'd be happy to hear from you. I'm not only interested in including people that I agree with, so please feel free to recommend someone as long as you believe that they meet the criteria.
